die.comp is a component which will intentionally segfault
during rtapi_app_main() (setup time) or in the RT thread
depending on the parameter

install with:

  cd src/tests
  comp --install die.comp

to fault setup-time:

  halcmd loadrt die

to fault during thread execution the comp's thread
function must execute:

   loadrt die inthread=1
   newthread thread1
   addf die thread1

   # starting the thread should create a segfault  of rtapi_app:
   start

or just do a

   halcmd -f segfault-rt-thread.hal
