/** The HAL is a very modular approach to the low level parts of a
    motion control system.  The goal of the HAL is to allow a systems
    integrator to connect a group of software components together to
    meet whatever I/O requirements he (or she) needs.  This includes
    realtime and non-realtime I/O, as well as basic motor control up
    to and including a PID position loop.  What these functions have
    in common is that they all process signals.  In general, a signal
    is a data item that is updated at regular intervals.  For example,
    a PID loop gets position command and feedback signals, and produces
    a velocity command signal.

    HAL is based on the approach used to design electronic circuits.
    In electronics, off-the-shelf components like integrated circuits
    are placed on a circuit board and their pins are interconnected
    to build whatever overall function is needed.  The individual
    components may be as simple as an op-amp, or as complex as a
    digital signal processor.  Each component can be individually
    tested, to make sure it works as designed.  After the components
    are placed in a larger circuit, the signals connecting them can
    still be monitored for testing and troubleshooting.

    Like electronic components, HAL components have pins, and the pins
    can be interconnected by signals.  At some point, I hope to be able
    to use a GPL'ed schematic capture program with a special HAL library
    to draw a "schematic" diagram with interconnected HAL components.
    You would then generate a netlist from the schematic, and the netlist
    would configure the HAL.  For now, however, HAL configuration will be
    done by a utility that parses a text file or works interactively.

    In the HAL, a 'signal' contains the actual data value that passes
    from one pin to another.  When a signal is created, space is allocated
    for the data value.  A 'pin' on the other hand, is a pointer, not a
    data value.  When a pin is connected to a signal, the pin's pointer
    is set to point at the signal's data value.  This allows the component
    to access the signal with very little run-time overhead.  (If a pin
    is not linked to any signal, the pointer points to a dummy location,
    so the realtime code doesn't have to deal with null pointers or treat
    unlinked variables as a special case in any way.)

    There are three approaches to writing a HAL component.  Those
    that do not require hard realtime performance can be written
    as a single user mode process.  Components that need hard realtime
    performance but have simple configuration and init requirements
    can be done as a single kernel module, using either pre-defined
    init info, or insmod-time parameters.  Finally, complex components
    may use both a kernel module for the realtime part, and a user
    space process to handle ini file access, user interface (possibly
    including GUI features), and other details.

    HAL uses the RTAPI/ULAPI interface.  If RTAPI is #defined, (done
    by the makefile) hal_lib.c would generate a kernel module hal_lib.o
    that is insmoded and provides the functions for all kernel module
    based components.  The same source file compiled with the ULAPI
    #define would make a user space hal_lib.o that is staticlly linked
    to user space code to make user space executables.  The variable
    lists and link information are stored in a block of shared memory
    and protected with mutexes, so that kernel modules and any of
    several user mode programs can access the data.

/** The 'hal_pin_xxx_new()' functions create a new 'pin' object.
    Once a pin has been created, it can be linked to a signal object
    using hal_link().  A pin contains a pointer, and the component
    that owns the pin can dereference the pointer to access whatever
    signal is linked to the pin.  (If no signal is linked, it points
    to a dummy signal.)
    There are eight functions, one for each of the data types that
    the HAL supports.  Pins may only be linked to signals of the same
    type.
    'name' is the name of the new pin.  It must be no longer than HAL_NAME_LEN.
    If there is already a pin with the same name the call will fail.
    'dir' is the pin direction.  It indicates whether the pin is
    an input or output from the component.
    'data_ptr_addr' is the address of the pointer that the component
    will use for the pin.  When the pin is linked to a signal, the
    pointer at 'data_ptr_addr' will be changed to point to the signal
    data location.  'data_ptr_addr' must point to memory allocated by
    hal_malloc().  Typically the component allocates space for a data
    structure with hal_malloc(), and 'data_ptr_addr' is the address
    of a member of that structure.
    'owner_id' is the ID of the component that will 'own' the
    variable.  Normally it should be the ID of the caller, but in
    some cases, a user mode component may be doing setup for a
    realtime component, so the ID should be that of the realtime
    component that will actually be using the pin.

    'name' is the name of the new function.  It must be no longer
    than HAL_NAME_LEN.  This is the name as it would appear in an ini
    file, which does not need to be the same as the C function name.
    'funct' is a pointer to the function code.  'funct' must be
    the address of a function that accepts a void pointer and
    a long int.  The pointer will be set to the value 'arg' below,
    and the long will be set to the thread period in nanoseconds.
    'arg' is a void pointer that will be passed to the function
    each time it is called.  This is useful when one actual
    C function will be exported several times with different HAL
    names, perhaps to deal with multiple instances of a hardware
    device.

    point.  When in doubt, make it non-zero.  If you are sure
    that the function doesn't use the FPU, then set 'uses_fp'
    to zero.

    hardware it accesses) is completely reentrant.  If reentrant
    is non-zero, the function may be prempted and called again
    before the first call completes.
