An interpolator for JointTrajectoryPoint segment queues

based on the Orocos KDL velocityprofile_spline code.

takes commands from a ringbuffer - feeder example in the Python script


the degree of interpolation can be modified by the <instance>.degree pin at runtime; legit values are 1 (linear), 3 (cubic), 5 (quintic).

missing/incomplete:

- end-of-segment logic incomplete; leftovers of the current segment are currently dropped
- jitter-correction not yet in place
- switching to linear interpolation on very small increments not yet in place
- no enable/disable/stopping logic
- force values currently ignored
- in linear mode, the acc pin is not set

demo:

halrun -I interpolate.hal

python feed-interpolator.py
