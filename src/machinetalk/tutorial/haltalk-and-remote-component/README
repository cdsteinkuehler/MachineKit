example for working with remote components

there are two ways to deal with remote comps:

- either its pins are predefined in halcmd like in simple-predefined-rcomp.hal
- or the halcmd script waits until after the remote entity startup to create the pins on initial bind (simple-remotely-defined.hal)


The two scripts show these styles - run either like so:

  ./rundemo simple-predefined-rcomp.hal

  ./rundemo simple-remotely-defined.hal


both will create and serve a tiny remote component (a led, button, linked to each other, plus some scales).
