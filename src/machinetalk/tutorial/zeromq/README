The examples in this directory show the zeroMQ usage patterns as used
in machinetalk. See http://zeromq.org and http://zeromq.github.io/pyzmq/ for details.


- DEALER/ROUTER for a request/reply type interaction
- PUB/SUB for publishing information to any number of subscribers, based on "topic"
- XPUB/XSUB: the same, but demonstrating notification of the publisher by a new subscriber,
  and the last subscriber going away (NOT for every unsubscribe!)

to run the demos, use 2 windows:

DEALER/ROUTER request/reply:
============================

  window1: python client-request.py
  window2: python server-reply.py

  Note that client-request.py does NOT fail if server-reply is not running -
  automatic reconnect is a core feature of zeromq.


PUB/SUB publishing:
==================

  window1: python publish-basic.py
  window2: python subscribe-basic.py

XPUB/XSUB publishing:
=====================

  window1: python publish-xpub.py
  window2: python subscribe-xsub.py
