# NB: you can now exit an instance selectively by
# delinst <instancename>, e.g. 'delinst first'
# see 'halcmd show' for the effect:
#   all pins, params and functs of this instance are gone
#   the 'second.in' and 'second.out' rings have no reader/writer id's any more
#   since the instance detached from them
#
# now try to bring it back with:
# newinst pbring second
# and have a look at 'halcmd show' to see what happened
