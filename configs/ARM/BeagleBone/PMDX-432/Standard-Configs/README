Example standard (generic) configurations for the K9 board

Initial Version: 22 July 2013

This is an example configuration for the BeagleBone platform, running with the PMDX-432 K9 CNC I/O Cape.
Configuration assumes the BeagelBoneBlack was booted with HDMIN device tree (HDMI w/o audio) as the boot time config (K9 uses the Audio pins on the BBB).

The K9 is configured for the Shapeoko mechanical kit plus the Inventable's stepper motors being driven from the on-board Pololu stepper drivers.

The initial configuration will be for a Shapeoko with 

Spindle: on/off rotary spindle.

Home switches: none

Limit Switches: none

BB IO: all GPIO, no direct PRU IO access.

This is a 4 axis + spindle subset of the K9 IO.
