Configurations for the K9 board running a Shapeoko Router
Initial Versions: 4 Aug 2013

This is an example configuration for the BeagleBone platform, running with the PMDX-432 K9 CNC I/O Cape.
Configuration assumes the BeagleBone Black was booted with HDMIN (HDMI w/o audio) for the base device tree (K9 uses the Audio pins on the BBB).

Ther are two configs for this machine:

GPIO-Driven: All BBB GPIO, no direct PRU IO access.

PRU-Driven: BBB direct PRU driving of S&D signals; the rest is GPIO.

The K9 is configured for the Shapeoko mechanical kit plus the Inventable's stepper motors being driven from the on-board Pololu stepper drivers.
This configuration is for a Shapeoko with 

Spindle: on/off rotary spindle.

Home switches: none

Limit Switches: none


This is a 4 axis + spindle subset of the K9 IO.
