Configurations for BeBoPr++ with BeagleBone Black.

The BeBoPr++ board supports 4 on-board axes, or 5 with external drivers.
The configurations in this tree are based on the signal assignments
from the BeBoPr++ user manual.

The Pololu configuration drives a standard 4-axis 3D printer, the Pepper
configuration is for the BeBoPr++ with Pepper 5-axis driver board.
Both configurations use the PRU for high speed step/dir pulse generation.

Both configurations do not use any of the eMMC and HDMI signals on the
BeagleBone Black, so these interfaces can remain enabled.
