This is an example for debugging PRU code with the haldebugpru component.

The assumed scenario is like so:

- there's some component (here: hal_pru) which loads some PRU code
- the hal_prudebug comp can be loaded separately, with a GladeVCP UI, to attach to the PRU
  and trace/singlestep/inspect the registers-
- the UI component can read the .dbg output of the PASM assembler to correlate the source line
  and program counter.

first, run 'make' in this directory
this will create the .bin and .dbg files

then run this as:

$ halcmd -f debugger-example.hal

- in the file chooser, select pruexample.dbg
- select stepping, contuous
- step through program by clicking continue

(on a beaglebone or some other AM335x CPU based board)

Notes:
- the glade editor in the arm ubuntu precise package stream is not good for editing the .ui file
  I did this on a normal livcd based PC
- the text highlighting/scrolling doesnt work reliable, I'd need a good example for Text view
  or gtksourceview for this.
- You might need to run 'sudo apt-get install python-gtksourceview2' .
