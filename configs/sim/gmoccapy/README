This is a simulation of an XYZ axis mill 
and also a lathe.

This screen is based of the design of moccagui, an GUI coded in FreePascal.

gmoccapy is using Python instead.

gmoccapy is designed to bring the feel of industrial controls to linuxccn users,
most controls can be used with a touch screen and also most are accesible through
hal pins, so real hardware can be used.
