This is a simulation of an XYZ plasma cutter (with metric units).

The main purpose of this is to show the posibilities offered by gscreen / gmoccapy to design custom screens.

This special layout has been made to control plasma cutters, many work has be done by Marius.

The original coolant and spindle frames are hidden, also the tool info frame and the spindle speed label in active gcode frame is hidden.
