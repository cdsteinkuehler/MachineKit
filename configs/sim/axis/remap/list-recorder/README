This is an example to show 'profile recording and replay' ("in principle") as discussed on emc-users, 'G71 lathe roughing cycle'



linuxcnc list-recorder.ini

hit run and see what happens.

To understand how things fit together:

- see the REMAP statements in cycle.ini
- python/remap.py contains the Python glue
- python/recorder.py is 'the profile recorder'


ps: if the self.execute("some gcode") call fails, the error message is less than helpful. This can be fixed.
