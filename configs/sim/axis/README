Axis is a modern, GL-based interface coded in python

Axis gui sim ini files:

axis.ini          basic demo (in)
axis_9axis.ini    9 axes
axis_foam         foam cutter
axis_mm.ini       basic demo (mm)
canterp           libcanterp.so
gantry.ini        gantry demo
lathe.ini         lathe demo
profile_axis.ini  profiling
random_tc.ini     random tool changer

Select one of these if you have no functional machine but want to edit some basic configuration stuff or play with one of the Machinekit displays.

Additional configurations are provided in subdirectories.

These configurations demonstrate Machinekit functionality using the axis gui as the interface.  (The functionality demonstrated may be available in other guis also)
