twopass.ini

This sim configuration demonstrates the use of TWOPASS processing for halfiles.

Twopass processing supports multiple loadrt specifications for any component.
So, for example:

file1.hal: loadrt or2 names=or2_a,or2_b
file2.hal: loadrt or2 names=or2_c,or2_d

Halfiles are read in two passes.  In the first pass, loadrt lines are accumulated but not executed.  In the second pass, all loadrt lines are executed in order.

Twopass processing occurs before gui loading.  When using a [HAL]POSTGUI_HALFILE, it is convenient to loadrt all components prior to loading the gui.  In this example, this is done with the file:

   load_for_postgui.hal

--------------------------------------
Notes:

Twopass processing for a component can use either names= or count= specifications.

Combinations of names=  and count= are not supported.

Using names= is recommended for both readability and portability.
