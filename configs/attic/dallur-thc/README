This config is for a plasma cutting machine with "stepper" control, along with ClassicLadder connections to some of the Machinekit IO.

It is based on the classicladder stepper sample config, but also includes a charge pump and a Torch Height Control system for Bob Cambells THC300 and CandCNC THC systems.

The stepper pinouts are for a standard breakout board/combo board as provided by Bob Campbell.

This configuration is out of date and will not run without updating, since it
uses freqgen, which has been removed in preparation for Machinekit 2.6.
