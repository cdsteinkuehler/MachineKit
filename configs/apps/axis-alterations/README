-- axis_mm.ini (AXIS based config, with mm settings) ------------

Demo of user keys, preview disable, load last file, write current file name, disable run, axis-remote --run etc

User Defined Command keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# precedes a halcmd
    This will be sent and the return waited for before continuing
....
$ precedes a system command
    This will be spawned to a new process and return immediately
....
No prefix before a gcode instruction

To bind the user keys to the numeric 0-9 keys
set NUMKEYS = YES
Use this carefully, the main reason for its inclusion
is to allow HID type pendant to operate commands from keystrokes
If using a keyboard probably best set to NO and just use Alt U + n (0-9).
.
Example:-

[USER_COMMANDS]
USER0 = #setp iocontrol.0.lube_level 1
USER1 = G0 X0 Y0 Z0
USER2 = G0 X5 Y5 Z5
USER3 = G0 X10 Y10 Z10
USER4 = G0 X15 Y15 Z15
USER5 = G0 X20 Y20 Z20
USER6 = G0 X25 Y25
USER7 = G0 X30 Y30
USER8 = $firefox "www.machinekit.io"
USER9 = $gedit
NUMBERKEYS = YES

Preview Disable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Loading big files can crash Axis if the preview is enabled, because it consumes huge amounts of memory
This option turns the preview off
The live plot will still be drawn

In the ini file

[USER_COMMANDS]
DISABLE_PREVIEW = YES

run-disable pin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pin called axisui.run-disable is created at startup of Axis

If this pin is TRUE (1) it will prevent any program being run

Use this pin in your hal file netted to signals from safety interlocks etc and you will prevent
a program being started which safety screens etc are open, but still allow jogging for touch off etc


Open Last File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unless Machinekit is launched with a file in the command line,
or there is a file specified to be opened in the ini file or in the environment variable,
the file that was open when machinekit was last closed, will be re-opened if the variable in the ini file is set.

[USER_COMMANDS]
LOAD_LASTFILE = YES


Write File Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To overcome the inability to interogate Axis as to what file it has open, it is now written to
/tmp/emc.filename whenever a file is opened.
If no file is open it will contain "No File Loaded"

This info can then be used in scripts etc.
The original purpose was to use it for a job timestamp file started and stopped with a M code script

Remote Run
~~~~~~~~~~~~

axis-remote has been extended to include a 'run' switch ( -R or --run )

A corresponding command in Axis will run the currently loaded file

This gives the ability to not only run MDI commands remotely, but to load a file and run it remotely
