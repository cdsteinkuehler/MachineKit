This directory uses the "motion-logger" test program to log the Motion
commands that come out of Task, as a result of running various ngc
G-code files.

Each test consists of a file named "$TEST.ngc" and a matching file named
"expected.$TEST".  The $TEST.ngc file is run, and the resulting Motion
commands are logged to a file named "result.$TEST".  If there is any
discrepancy, the test fails.

In between running each .ngc file, a special file named "reset.ngc"
is run, intending to restore Task, Interp, and the Canon interface to
their default startup state, to be ready to run the next .ngc file.
